Live555 RTSP-Proxyserver. Extended by eth-Iface-bindings
If you need to get RTSP-Streams from a closed LAN, just set up a bridge system with 2 network interfaces and bind this proxy to the RTSP-Source-LAN.
This program is completely based on the Live555 Proxy Server, taken from [Live555 Proxy Server](http://www.live555.com/proxyServer/), with optimized command line usage and interface bindings added.


##Getting started


You will need the QT Creator and live55-Libs if you want to compile this project.
